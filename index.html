                Rahila Sagar Sun Temple in Mahoba (Bundelkhand) which was built more than 1000 years ago by Chandelas,
                is an example of a prestigious Indian cultural heritage that is going in vain due to ignorance from the
                government.The Majestic Rahila Sagar Sun Temple (Locally known as Rahiliya temple) has located 3 km from
                Mahoba in
                a southwest direction near Mirtala and Rahiliya village. In this temple, Chandela kings used to worship
                the sun. In those days the sun was considered as a source of energy, health, and positivity in life and
                Kings use to worship the sun so they will stay in power for long time.
